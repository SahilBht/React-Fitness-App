# Motive
This project was created with the primary goal of self-learning, specifically to gain a deeper understanding of React 18, React components, and integrating third-party APIs. The React Fitness App is an embodiment of this learning journey.

# Features
The React Fitness App is designed to help users explore and learn about various gym exercises. It is powered by React 18 and utilizes the Rapid API's Exercise Database API for exercise information. The app also employs Material-UI for a sleek and modern user interface. Key features of the app include:

## Explore Exercise
- Clicking on this option will take you to the Exercise Card section, where you can discover a wide range of exercises.

## Search Exercise
- Search for exercises based on specific body parts and keywords. Get a list of exercises tailored to your search criteria.

## Exercise Cards
- When you click on an exercise card, you will be redirected to a dedicated page for that exercise. This page includes the following sections:

### 1. Exercise Information
   - Provides detailed information about the exercise, including the body parts it targets and its benefits.

### 2. YouTube Videos
   - Features a collection of YouTube videos demonstrating the exercise to ensure proper form and technique.

### 3. Similar Target Muscle Exercises
   - Recommends other exercises that target the same muscles as the selected exercise. This can help users diversify their workout routines.

### 4. Similar Equipment Exercises
   - Suggests exercises that can be performed with similar gym equipment, making it easy for users to incorporate variations in their workouts.
